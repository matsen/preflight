# Preflight document for {project title} by {author}

## What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using words that would be familiar to someone who had taken an undergraduate class in the topic.


## Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?


## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?


## What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?


## What is a best case scenario hypothetical result? Try to be as specific as possible. Use your imagination!


## What are the potential bad outcomes? Any overall concerns here?


## Is there pre-existing work/code that could be leveraged to explore the potential for bad outcomes? To do proof-of-concept investigation to get a first-pass answer for the underlying scientific question?


## Are there any other categorically different approaches that could be applied here?


## If this is a methods project, what methods will you compare to? Can you get them running before writing new code?


## What data will you use? Are there appropriate hold-out sets?


## Is it possible that better data would make this project irrelevant?


## Sketch the approach, broken down into steps, with expected amounts of time and intermediate steps for each.


### Stage 1 (X months):


#### How do we decide to move onto the next stage?
