# Preflight Template

This template is an expanded version of the [Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.darpa.mil/about/heilmeier-catechism), specifically adapted for computational biology research projects. The original Heilmeier Catechism was developed by George Heilmeier during his time as DARPA director to evaluate research proposals and projects.

Our expanded version includes additional questions tailored to computational biology, such as:
- Methods comparison and baseline implementation
- Data requirements and holdout sets
- Pre-existing code and tools that could be leveraged
- Alternative computational approaches
- Data quality considerations

This framework provides a structured approach for thinking through computational biology research projects by addressing both the fundamental research questions of the original catechism and the specific methodological considerations important in computational work.

Additional inspiration for the computational biology-specific questions comes from William Stafford Noble's "[Ten simple rules for defining a computational biology project](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010786)" (Noble WS (2023) PLoS Comput Biol 19(1): e1010786).
