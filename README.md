The original Heilmeier Catechism was developed by George Heilmeier during his time as DARPA director to evaluate research proposals and projects.

Additional inspiration came from Bill Noble's excellent "[Ten simple rules for defining a computational biology project](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010786)".
