# Preflight template for computational biology research

Is an idea likely to give results that will advance the field?

Our "preflight check" framework provides a structured approach for thinking through computational biology research projects.

To use, simply copy one of the two template files and fill in the questions.

[Simon Frost](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/frost.simon) introduced me to the [Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.darpa.mil/about/heilmeier-catechism), specifically adapted for computational biology research projects. The original Heilmeier Catechism was developed by George Heilmeier during his time as DARPA director to evaluate research proposals and projects.

Additional inspiration for the computational biology-specific questions comes from Bill Noble's "[Ten simple rules for defining a computational biology project](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010786)".
